How to get it running
------------------------

```
git clone git@github.com:dmitric/tap-pad-ios.git
pod install
open TapPad.xcworkspace
```

The only external dependency is AFNetworking and I use CocoaPods to load it in. You need CocoaPods to build this project.

About

Generate interesting musical patterns using basic rules of cellular automatons.

You'd be surprised how beautiful some of these "random" yet 100% reproducible patterns are. Its sounds totally unique, but it's completely deterministic.
